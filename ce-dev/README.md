# Helper stack for working locally on Ansible roles.

This will spin up some Docker containers to be able to run roles against.
By default, it will create:

- a "controller" container, which acts as the provisioning server. This "ce-provision" repo is mounted at /home/ce-dev/ce-provision, so all changes (to roles, etc) made from your host computer are directly available within the container
- a blank target server, called **provision-target**, which has standard privileges and should be used for most usecases.
- another blank target server, called **provision-privileged**, that runs as a privileged container. This is needed for eg the gitlab role.

## Pre-requesites

You'll need https://github.com/codeenigma/ce-dev installed.

You'll need to set up a `config` directory in the root of the cloned `ce-provision` project, the deploy playbooks expect it to exist and to have `ansible.cfg` within. If you already have a private config repo for your organisation that should be cloned here. If you do not, you can use our provided example repo to get started with - https://github.com/codeenigma/ce-provision-config-example

## Usage

### 1. Generate the actual docker-compose file and start the containers

`ce-dev init && ce-dev start`

### 2. Provision the controller server

`ce-dev provision`

This needs to be done first, so the deploy user can be correctly populated and the controller server is setup.

### 3. Amend the git remote(s)

The setup step uses the standard repo path, https://github.com/codeenigma/ce-provision.git which is not suitable for pushing/MR.
You need to manually amend it to use the ssh version (or point it to your private fork).

```
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:codeenigma/ce-provision.git
```

### 4. Create your playbook(s)

You can start creating playbooks in the ce-dev/ansible/local directory which is .gitignored (copy them from the examples folder).

When testing locally, you can put `is_local: yes` in the list of variables in your playbook. This will prevent certain roles from being installed, such as if you're including the **nginx** role, which has a dependency on the **aws/aws_cloudwatch_agent** role _except_ for when `is_local` is defined.

Or you can include the 'common.yml' vars file, as it will set all the needed variables to be able to work locally and call ansible-playbook directly without going through the wrapper script (see below).

### 5. Ensure your hosts are properly configured

If you run step 6 without hosts configured you will get a `skipping: no hosts matched` message and nothing will happen. There needs to be a `hosts` or `hosts.yml` file in your config directory, which is fetched during the Pre-requesites step above, for example:

* https://github.com/codeenigma/ce-provision-config-example/blob/master/hosts/hosts.yml

You need to ensure this exists and the correct IP addresses are defined (you can check this with `ping` or by looking at the `/etc/hosts` file on the host machine). Note, other formats are also valid. See the docs for details:

* https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html

### 6. Run, amend/create your roles, rince and repeat

`ce-dev shell`

Select the `provision-controller` instance to connect to. From there, you can run a playbook to provision the provision-target server. There are two ways to run playbooks.

1.  From the **~/ce-provision** directory, run:
    `ansible-playbook ce-dev/ansible/local/provision-target.yml`

1.  Use the `provision.sh` wrapper script. As you're working locally, you can use the `--workspace` argument:
    `/bin/sh /home/ce-dev/ce-provision/scripts/provision.sh --repo unused --branch master --workspace /home/ce-dev/ce-provision --playbook ce-dev/ansible/local/provision-target.yml`

        The `--repo` and `--branch` arguments are still mandatory, but they won't be used because you're passing in the `--workspace` argument as well, so you can pass through any value for those two arguments. The `--workspace` and `--playbook` arguments **must** create an absolute path to the playbook that you want to run.
