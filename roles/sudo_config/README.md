# sudo config
Manages sudo permissions. Note, this role does not install any form of `sudo` package, it assumes the required packages are already installed and simply ensures the existance of `/etc/sudoers.d` and places a correctly formatted config file within. If `sudo.entity_name` is not set it will do nothing.
