  domains: # you can provide multiple domains if you need
    - www.example.com
  # Handling for certs, can be one of:
  # - letsencrypt: Generates individual LetsEncrypt certificate using the HTTP challenge
  # - selfsigned: Generates self-signed certificates
  # - manual: Use provided certificates. Requires key/cert.
  # - unmanaged: Doesn't do anything. Note that for consistency reasons, key/cert paths are still needed.
  handling: selfsigned
  # For "manual" handling, this is the content of the certificate.
  # If you want to to provide a file instead, use lookup('file', '/path/on/the/controller') as the value.
  # For "unmanaged" handling, this must be set to the absolute path on the target.
  # For "manual" handling you can optionally include a ca_cert variable if your CA cert must be a separate file.
