# Contributed roles
This is a space for ce-provision to clone roles we use into. It is specifically for roles not available via [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com), which is always the preferred route for including other roles.

They will be installed from [the `ce_provision.contrib_roles` variable](https://github.com/codeenigma/ce-provision/blob/devel-2.x/roles/debian/ce_provision/defaults/main.yml#L27-L33).
