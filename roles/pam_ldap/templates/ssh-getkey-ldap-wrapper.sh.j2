# This script wraps the script stored here:
# - https://github.com/codeenigma/ssh-getkey-ldap
#
# The reason for the wrapper is AuthorizedKeysCommand in sshd config will only pass a username
# yet if you need to provide a bind DN the script needs to accept at least two arguments,
# probably three if you have a bind password too. This script passes in the bind DN and
# password to ssh-getkey-ldap leaving sshd conf to pass the authenticating user only.
