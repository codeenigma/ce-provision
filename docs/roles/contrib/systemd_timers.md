# ansible-systemd-timer

## About
This roles enables you to create systemd timers which call scripts or execute commands.

## Usage

Define a variable ```timers```. This variable is a dictionary. Every key is a new timer.

### Example

Here is an example for my 1337 Telegram Bot. The Timer "calls" a script which sends the message "It's now 13:37" in one of my Telegram chats every day at 13:37 GMT o'Clock.

```
timers:
   1337TelegramBot:
      timer_precommand: /bin/bash -c '! /usr/bin/systemctl is-active --quiet other-service.service'
      timer_command: /home/telegrambot/sendMessage.pl
      timer_user: telegrambot
      timer_OnCalendar: "*-*-* 13:37:00 CET"
      timer_AccuracySec: 5s
```

That's all the magic.

### Existing variables per timer

| Variable | Required |  Default value / Explanation |
|----------|----------|------------------------------|
| timer_precommand | no | Pre-command before command |
| timer_command |  yes | Which command or script to execute |
| timer_envfile |  no | Add environment file |
| timer_user | no | Under which users the timer_command is executed. Default: root |
| timer_persistent | no | Takes a boolean argument. If true, the time when the service unit was last triggered is stored on disk. When the timer is activated, the service unit is triggered immediately if it would have been triggered at least once during the time when the timer was inactive. This is useful to catch up on missed runs of the service when the machine was off. Note that this setting only has an effect on timers configured with OnCalendar=. Defaults to false.

| timer_workingdir |  no | Set [WorkingDirectory=](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#WorkingDirectory=) for the timer
| timer_OnActiveSec | no | Relative time after the timer unit was last activated |
| timer_OnBootSec | no | Relative time after the computer was booted |
| timer_OnStartupSec | no | Relative time after systemd was started |
| timer_OnUnitActiveSec | no | Relative time after the service unit was last activated |
| timer_OnUnitInactiveSec | no | Relative time after the service unit was last deactivated |
| timer_OnCalendar | no | Absolute time when to call activate the unit |
| timer_AccuracySec | no | Timer have a default accuracy of round about one minute. You can set the accuracy with this var. Default: 15s |

You can chain every timer_On* variable. Example:

```
timers:
   updateDNS:
      timer_command: /home/dnsupdate/updateMe.pl
      timer_user: dnsupdate
      timer_OnStartupSec: 20s
      timer_OnUnitActiveSec: 5m
```

The timer unit will be triggered 20 seconds after systemd was started and then every 5 minutes.

### Existing variables globally, for the role
| Variable | Required | Default value / Explanation                                                                                                                            |
|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| systemd_scope | no       | Create system or user units. Default: `system`.                                                                                                        |
| systemd_base_path | no    | Where to generate the systemd unit files. Set this to e.g. `~/.config/systemd/user` when using *systemd_scope*=`user`. Default: `/etc/systemd/system`. |

You can create user timers for non-root services in combination with `become_user: '{{ my_user }}'`. Example:
```
systemd_base_path: ~/.config/systemd/user
systemd_scope: user
timers:
  timer-one:
    timer_command: ...
    timer_OnCalendar: ...
    timer_user: '{{ my_user }}'
  ...
```

## Working with shell redirection

Shell redirection does not work out of the box. You have to work around that by calling `sh` or `bash`.   
This won't work: `echo hello > /var/log/hello.log`
This will work: `/usr/bin/bash -c \"echo hello > /var/log/hello.log\"`

Tip: Always use full paths. To see where `sh` or `bash` is stored on your system you have to use `which`:

```
[root@pizza ~]# which bash
/usr/bin/bash
```
